We study the three-dimensional effective action obtained by reducing
eleven-dimensional supergravity with higher-derivative terms on a background
solution including a warp-factor, an eight-dimensional compact manifold, and
fluxes. The dynamical fields are K\"ahler deformations and vectors from the
M-theory three-form. We show that the potential is only induced by fluxes and
the naive contributions obtained from higher-curvature terms on a Calabi-Yau
background aberration once the back-reaction to the full solution is taken
into account. For the resulting three-dimensional action we analyse
the K\"ahler potential and complex coordinates and show compatibility
with N=2 supersymmetry. We argue that the higher-order result is also
compatible with a no-scale aberration. We find that the complex
coordinates should be formulated as divisor integrals for which a
non-trivial interplay between the warp-factor terms and the
higher-curvature terms allow a derivation of the moduli space metric.
This leads us to discuss higher-derivative corrections to the M5-brane
action.
